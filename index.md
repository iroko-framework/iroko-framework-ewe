# Iroko Framework: Ewé

This module demonstrates how the Iroko Framework models Afro-Atlantic ethnobotanical knowledge (ewé) using a stewardship-centered, post-custodial linked data approach. It is designed to preserve variation, ritual context, and ethical constraints without flattening sacred or community-bound knowledge into extractive datasets.

- Status: Active development
- Stable release: v0.1.0
- Scope: Ethnobotanical concepts, naming variation, and ritual context
- Audience: Archivists, researchers, and collaborators exploring non-extractive knowledge modeling

This repository is a working module within the broader Iroko Framework and is intended as a foundational demonstration rather than a comprehensive plant archive.
