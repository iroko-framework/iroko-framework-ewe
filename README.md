# IROKO FRAMEWORK  
## iroko: ewe module

The **Iroko Framework: Ewé Module** models Afro-Atlantic ethnobotanical knowledge using a stewardship-centered, post-custodial linked data approach. It preserves naming variation, ritual classification, medicinal classification, and ethical access control without flattening culturally bounded knowledge into extractive datasets.

This module demonstrates how structured vocabularies can support Afro-Atlantic archival infrastructure while respecting community governance and disclosure boundaries.

## Status

- **Stable release:** v0.2.0  
- **Development branch:** `main`  
- **Scope:** Ethnobotanical concepts, naming variation, medicinal use classification, ritual use classification, and access governance

Machine-readable vocabulary (Turtle):

## Design Principles

- Separation of botanical description from ritual specificity  
- Controlled vocabularies for medicinal and ritual classification  
- Explicit access governance through `accessLevel`  
- Narrative ritual description governed by disclosure rules  
- Preservation of naming ambiguity through collision modeling  

This repository contains the vocabulary source and documentation. It is not a comprehensive plant database, but a modular framework for ethical linked data modeling.
